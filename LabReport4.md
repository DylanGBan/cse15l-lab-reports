# CSE 15L Lab Report 4

***Steps taken for time improvment -***

>__Warning__: These keyboard shortcuts are for mac and slightly differ from windows

**Step 1:**

- When logging into my ssh account, I simply copied and pasted the command with my specific login.

>__Note__: When logging into my account, it does not propmt me to type my password, due to the fact that my personal 
machine's ssh key has been saved into the remote server under my account.

> &uarr; Keys Pressed: `<command> + <c> , <command> + <v> , <enter>`

> These keys were used to copy (`<command> + <c>`) the line `ssh cs15lwi23acp@ieng6.ucsd.edu` from my personal machine's notepad and 
was pasted (`<command> + <v>`) in the ternmainl, which was then followed by a key press of (`<enter>`), allowing for the command to be excuted 
and letting me login into the remote server.

**Step 2:**

- When excuting git clone, the command is already saved in the history from pervious attempts

>__Note__: For lab report purposes, I deleted the repository from my remote machine, then git cloned it again

> &uarr; Keys Pressed: `<up> x10 + <enter>`

> Before using my up arrow to go back to my past commands, I simply typed `History` in the terminal, allowing me to see how far 
away the command was. Then using my up arrows ten times (`<up>`), I moved to the command wanted, then I clicked enter (`<enter>`) which clonned the git hub repository.

**Step 3:** 

- Running the test file located in the `lab7` repository
