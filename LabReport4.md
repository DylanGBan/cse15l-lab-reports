# CSE 15L Lab Report 4

***Steps taken for time improvment -***

>__Warning__: These keyboard shortcuts are for mac, and slightly differ from windows

**Step 1:**

- When logging into my ssh account, I simply copied and pasted the command with my specific login.

>__Note__: When logging into my account, it does not propmt me to type my password, due to the fact that my personal 
machine's ssh key has been saved into the remote server under my account.

> &uarr; Keys Pressed: `<command> + <c>`,`<command> + <v>`, `<enter>`

> These keys were used to copy (`<command> + <c>`) the line `ssh cs15lwi23acp@ieng6.ucsd.edu` from my personal machine's notepad and 
was pasted (`<command> + <v>`) in the ternmainl, which was then followed by a key press of (`<enter>`), allowing for the command to be excuted 
and letting me login into the remote server.

**Step 2:**

- When excuting git clone, the command is already saved in the history from pervious attempts

>__Note__: For lab report purposes, I deleted the repository from my remote machine, then git cloned it again

> &uarr; Keys Pressed: `<up> x10 + <enter>`

> Before using my up arrow to go back to my past commands, I simply typed `History` in the terminal, allowing me to see how far 
away the command was. Then using my up arrow ten times (`<up>`), I moved to the command wanted, then I clicked enter (`<enter>`) which clonned the git hub repository.

**Step 3:** 

- Running the test file located in the `lab7` repository

> &uarr; Keys Pressed: `<up> x5 + <enter>`, `<up> x6 + <enter>`

> Before using my up arrow to go back to my past commands, I simply typed `cd lab7` to go into the correct directory and `History` in the terminal, allowing me to see how far away the command was. Then using my up arrow 5 times (`<up>`), I moved to the command wanted, then I clicked enter (`<enter>`) which compliled the testerfile leading me to use my up arrow 6 times (`<up>`) again and clicking enter (`<enter>`) which ran the tester file. 

**Step 4:** 

- Editing the file `ListExamples.java` using nano

> &uarr; Keys Pressed: `<down> x42 + <right> x12 + <delete> + <click 2>`, `<control> + <x> + <y> + <enter>` 

> Before being able to edit the file, the command `nano ListExamples.java` must be ran. When the command is ran, the file contents will appear and 
now can be edited. Then using my down arrow 42 times (`<down>`), I got to the line which needed to be edited. Now using my right arrow 12 times 
(`<right>`) I got to the character, `1`, that caused the error and delete it and put in a `2` instead. After that, I exit nano using (`<control> + <x>`)
which then promps me to save my changes which I then type `y` allowing the changes to be saved. Then it promps me with the name of the file to be changed, but since I don't want it to be change, I just click (`<enter>`) to save the file under the same name.

**Step 5:** 

- Running the test file located in the `lab7` repository, after fixing the file

> &uarr; Keys Pressed: `<up> x5 + <enter>`, `<up> x6 + <enter>`
 
> I used my up arrow 5 times (`<up>`), I moved to the command wanted, then I clicked enter (`<enter>`) which compliled the testerfile leading me to use my up arrow 6 times (`<up>`) again and clicking enter (`<enter>`) which ran the tester file. 

**Step 6:**

- Commit and pushing the file to my git hub repository

> &uarr; Keys Pressed: `<up> + <enter>`, `<up> + <enter>`

> Before using my up arrows, I entered the command `History` in the terminal. This allows me to see my past commands that I have used. I then use my up arrow (`<up>`) to navigate to the command I want to use, then click enter (`<enter>`). I do this for `git add`, `git commit -m`, and `git push`
